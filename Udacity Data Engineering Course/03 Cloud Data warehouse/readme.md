## What is Data Warehouse

### Operational vs Analytical Business Process

### Operation Processes (make it work):
-   Find goods & make orders (for customers)
-   Stocks and find goods(for inventory staff)
-   Pick up and deliver goods (for delivery staff)
-   Operational Databases, excellent for operations
-   Operational Databases, no redundancy, high integrity.

### Analytical Processes (what is going on?)
-   Assess the performance of sales staff (for HR)
-   See the effect of different sales channesl (for marketing)
-   Monitor sales growth(for management).
-   Operational Databases, too slow for analytics, too many joins
-   Operational Databases, are too hard to understand. Because they are model for data storage.

Data Warehouse is a system(including processes, technologies & data representations) that enables us to support analytical processes.
