## Relational Data Model

### Databases

### Importance of Relational Databases

### OLAP VS OLTP
Online Analytical Processing (OLAP):
    Databases optimized for these workloads allow for complex analytical and ad hoc queries. These type of databases are optimized for reads. OLAP queries can tell you how many shoes that was sold last week in California.

Online Transactional Processing (OLTP):
    Databases optimized for these workloads allow for less complex queries in large volume. The types of queries for these databases are read, insert, update, and delete. OLTP will tell you the price of the shoe. It has little or no aggregation.
